# Delivery Route Optimization System
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an eEicient package delivery system that minimizes travel time and optimizes delivery routes. By leveraging Quicksort to arrange delivery locations in an optimal order and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithmto compute the shortest paths, the system will ensure faster and more cost-eEective deliveries. This approach will help improve logistics eEiciency, reduce fuel consumption, and enhance overall delivery performance.
